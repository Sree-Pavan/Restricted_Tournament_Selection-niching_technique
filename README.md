# Restricted_Tournament_Selection-niching_technique

 The niching algorithm that was implemented from scratch is Restricted Tournament selection. As
the paper by Singh and Deb, explores various algorithms and their performance, RTS stood on
the top. It was able to predict different parks with varying amplitudes and frequencies. I have
implemented the RTS algorithm with a test function that was taken from the paper by Singh and
Deb. This project is to describe the RTS algorithm and understand the effectiveness of the
algorithm.
